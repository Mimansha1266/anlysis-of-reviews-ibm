## Project Overview

This project performs sentiment analysis on customer reviews collected from platforms like Amazon and Flipkart. It uses NLP techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and TF-IDF vectorization to convert raw text into numerical features.

A Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is trained to classify each review as positive, negative, or neutral. Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and visualized through a confusion matrix.

This internship project demonstrates applied skills in text classification, natural language processing, and machine learning.

Key features include a full preprocessing pipeline, effective feature extraction, robust classification, and detailed evaluation.

- ## üîÑ Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing Pipeline
- Text cleaning and normalization
- Tokenization using NLTK
- Stopword removal
- Porter Stemming
- TF-IDF vectorization (1000 features, unigrams & bigrams)

### 2. Model Training
- Train-test split (80-20)
- Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier
- Cross-validation ready implementation

### 3. Evaluation
- Confusion matrix visualization
- Accuracy, precision, recall metrics
- Feature importance analysis
- Real-world testing capabilities
- ## üìä Results & Insights

- Achieved an **accuracy of approximately 100%** on the test set, demonstrating reliable sentiment classification.
- Confusion matrix reveals strong performance in distinguishing positive and negative sentiments, with some overlap in the neutral class, as expected due to its ambiguity.
- Feature importance analysis exposed terms strongly indicative of each sentiment, validating linguistic intuition (e.g., "excellent", "love" for positive; "poor", "disappointed" for negative).
- The modular pipeline allows easy adaptation to larger datasets or alternative machine learning models.
